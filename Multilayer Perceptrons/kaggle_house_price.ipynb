    "In the previous sections, we introduced\n",
    "the basic tools for building deep networks\n",
    "and performing capacity control via\n",
    "dimensionality-reduction, weight decay and dropout.\n",
    "You are now ready to put all this knowledge into practice\n",
    "by participating in a Kaggle competition.\n",
    "[Predicting house prices](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) is a great place to start:\n",
    "the data is reasonably generic and does not have\n",
    "the kind of rigid structure that might require specialized models\n",
    "the way images or audio might.\n",
    "This dataset, collected by Bart de Cock in 2011 :cite:`De-Cock.2011`, is considerably larger than the famous the [Boston housing dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/housing.names) of Harrison and Rubinfeld (1978).\n",
    "It boasts both more examples and more features,\n",
    "covering house prices in Ames, IA from the period of 2006-2010.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will walk you through details of data preprocessing,\n",
    "model design, hyperparameter selection and tuning.\n",
    "We hope that through a hands-on approach,\n",
    "you will be able to observe the effects of capacity control,\n",

    "## Kaggle\n",
    "\n",
    "[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) is a popular platform\n",
    "for machine learning competitions.\n",
    "It combines data, code and users in a way to allow\n",
    "for both collaboration and competition.\n",
    "While leaderboard chasing can sometimes get out of control,\n",
    "there is also a lot to be said for the objectivity in a platform\n",
    "that provides fair and direct quantitative comparisons\n",
    "between your approaches and those devised by your competitors.\n",
    "Moreover, you can checkout the code\n",
    "from (some) other competitors' submissions\n",
    "and pick apart their methods to learn new techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the House Prices Prediction page as illustrated \n",
    "in `fig_house_pricing`, you can find the dataset (under the \"Data\" tab),\n",

    "roof type, basement condition, etc.\n",
    "The features represent multiple data types.\n",
    "Year of construction, for example, is represented with integers\n",
    "roof type is a discrete categorical feature,\n",
    "other features are represented with floating point numbers.\n",
    "And here is where reality comes in:\n",
    "for some examples, some data is altogether missing\n",
    "with the missing value marked simply as 'na'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The price of each house is included for the training set only\n",
    "(it is a competition after all).\n",
    "You can partition the training set to create a validation set,\n",
    "but you will only find out how you perform on the official test set\n",
    "when you upload your predictions and receive your score.\n",
    "The \"Data\" tab on the competition tab has links to download the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will read and process the data using `pandas`,\n",
    "an [efficient data analysis toolkit](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/), so you will want to make sure that you have `pandas` installed\n",
    "before proceeding further. Fortunately, if you are reading in Jupyter,\n",
    "we can install pandas without even leaving the notebook."
